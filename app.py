    The hybrid recommendation system provides product recommendations based on the products the customer owns.
    The system is based on 3 recommendation engines:
    - The first looks for similarities between users and recommends products with the highest likelihood ratio.
    - Another recommendation engine is based on a machine learning model that recommends suitable products based on classification.
    - The third model is based on the most popular products.
    
    The results of all recommendation engines are combined using weights.
    Finally, a list of recommended products is presented to the user.
